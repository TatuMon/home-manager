# <h1 align="center">üè† Home Manager</h1>

![preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TatuMon/home-manager/refs/heads/main/home-manager.jpeg "Preview")

# Requirements
- [Nix (the package manager)](https://nixos.org/learn/)
- [NixGL (only for standalone home-manager)](https://github.com/nix-community/nixGL?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

# Installation
> To install home-manager, please refer to the [manual page](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#ch-installation)

I personally use the standalone `home-manager` tool, but this configuration
should also work for the `home-manager` NixOS module. I didn't test it.

# Notes
### Hyprland
This repo only contains the hyprland and waybar configuration files.
To install the binaries, you have to do it yourself with your system's package
manager

As I stated above, I'm using the standalone version, so I decided to install
Hyprland system-wide and manage it using my distro's systemd.

### Why NixGL
NixGL solves the issue where packages installed using Nix can't access
OpenGL drivers.

This doesn't happen in NixOS.
